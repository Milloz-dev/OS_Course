Which process is the parent and which is the child process?
Parent process message = getpid() and child pid
Child process message = getpid() and parent getppid()

The variable i is used in both processes. Is the value of i in one process affected when the other process increments
it? Why/Why not?

The value of i in one process is not affected by ther other process incrementing it. this happen because of:
*Memory Separation after fork()
*No shared Variables Between processes. i is a local variable
*Copy-on-Write Mechanism

Modify the program in two ways:
• Let the program create a third process, that writes 100 "C" (similarly to "A" and "B")
• In the parent process, print out the process id (pid) of each of the child processes. It is not allowed to use getpid()
to get the process id of the child processes.

Which are the process identities (pid) of the child processes?
In parent => First child's pid: 18587
In parent => Second child's pid: 18588
