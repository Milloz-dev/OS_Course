Task 14. Parallelization of the initialization

Parallelize the initialization of the matrices also, i.e., the function init_matrix. Use one thread to initialize each of the
rows in the matrices a and b. Compile, link, and execute your program.


Which is the execution time and speedup for the application now?

Time taken: 6.439237 seconds

Did the program run faster or slower now, and why?

The program ran faster

Because initializing rows simultaneously divides the workload among threads, effectively utilizing the multi-core processor
